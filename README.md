# Labyrinth solver
Program where you can decide the number of levels, the length and the width of the labyrinth.

Walls will be randomly generated. After that the A*-algorithm is used to calculate the shortest 

path from start to exit. If there is no path a message tells you that you are trapped.



Took me around **14 hours** to develop with research + implementation + testing.



Here's a link for a good explanation of the A*-algorithm.
