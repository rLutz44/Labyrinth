# Labyrinth solver
Program where you can decide the number of levels, the length and, the width of the labyrinth.

Walls will be randomly generated. After that the A*-algorithm is used to calculate the shortest 

path from start to exit. Also outputs if there is no path.



Took me around **14 hours** to develop with research + implementation + testing.
